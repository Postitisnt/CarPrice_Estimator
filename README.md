# CarPrice Estimator

In this repository you will find a model aimed at estimating the selling price of a car based on some variables. The project involves the use of Neural Networks for feature reconstruction and prediction as part of the featire engineering pipeline. The final prediction has been carried out thanks to some Machine Learning algorithms.
